Note: When running the JAR file, the images do not appear for some reason.

To use ThunderBit, simply press on specific areas to click through the screens:
When time is available, click on the time.
When there is an image (or a space where the image should be), click on the image.
When you want to change user data or the time, click the settings and proceed.
To add a goal, determine whether there is a plus sign on the screen. If so, click it and proceed.
